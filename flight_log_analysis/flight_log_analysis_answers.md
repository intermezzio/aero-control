Flight Log Analysis

Example

Manual to position control switch: 1:23 

Max velocity = 0.82 m/s

Max deviation (estimate and target position)

     X Â 0.18 m

     Y 0.12 m 

     Z 0.10 m 

Pattern of flight during position control

     More expansive than manual, less confined and centralized

     Seemingly less random than manual

     Roughly square/circular

Max acceleration

     26.5 m/s^2

Takeoff: 0:10 

Land: 3:39

Max diff in Z: 0.19 m 

COM_POS_FS_EPH = 50000

EKF2_AID_MASK = 2

EKF2_HGT_MODE = 2




Our flight 7/10/18

Max velocity = 0.1 m/s 

Max deviation 

     X N/A

     Y N/A

     Z N/A

Pattern of flight - N/A

Max acceleration = 1.1 m/s 

Takeoff: 0:00

Land: 19:25  

COM_POS_FS_EPH (Horizontal position threshold) = 50000

EKF2_AID_MASK (Integer bitmask controlling data fusion and aiding methods) = 2

EKF2_HGT_MODE (Determines the primary source of height data) = 2
